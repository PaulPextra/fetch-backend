3. What has been a favorite school/personal project thus far? What about it challenged you?

Answer:
One of my favorite projects was building an edtech system that allowed students to access resources, track progress, and join interactive lessons. The challenge was creating a scalable platform for different users—students, teachers, and administrators—while ensuring real-time data processing, security, and a seamless experience across devices.

The toughest part was optimizing the system to handle live classroom interactions between students and teachers. I had to develop efficient algorithms and ensure the platform could scale as the user base grew. Despite the challenges, it was a rewarding experience that taught me a lot about full-stack development and user-focused design.
